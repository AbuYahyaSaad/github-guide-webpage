# GitHub Actions - Quick Start Guide 🚀

## Is GitHub Actions Free? YES! ✅

### Free Tier Includes:
- ✅ **Public repos**: UNLIMITED minutes
- ✅ **Private repos**: 2,000 minutes/month
- ✅ **Storage**: 500 MB for artifacts
- ✅ **Concurrent jobs**: 20 (public) / 1 (private)

### Your Project Usage Estimate:
With the workflows I've created, you'll use approximately:
- **Per month**: ~400-500 minutes (25% of free tier)
- **Cost**: $0 (completely free!)

## 📁 What I've Created for You:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── simple-cicd.yml      # ⭐ START HERE - Basic CI/CD
    ├── deploy.yml           # Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages
    ├── quality-check.yml    # Code quality validation
    ├── test-optimize.yml    # Performance testing
    └── README.md           # Detailed documentation
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### 1. Push These Files to GitHub
```bash
cd C:\Users\MohammadSaad\GRIHA_april_project\Claude_agent\check
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines"
git push
```

### 2. See It in Action
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. Watch your workflows run automatically!

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
3. Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/github-guide-webpage/`

## 💡 What Each Workflow Does:

### 🌟 simple-cicd.yml (Recommended)
```yaml
Triggers: Every push to main
Actions: 
  - Validates HTML
  - Deploys to GitHub Pages
Time: ~3 minutes
```

### 🚀 deploy.yml
```yaml
Triggers: Push to main + manual
Actions: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Time: ~2 minutes
```

### ✅ quality-check.yml
```yaml
Triggers: All pushes & PRs
Actions:
  - HTML validation
  - CSS linting
  - JavaScript linting
  - Security scan
Time: ~7 minutes
```

### 📊 test-optimize.yml
```yaml
Triggers: Weekly + pushes

  - Performance testing
  - Accessibility checks
  - Image optimization
  - Spell check
Time: ~12 minutes
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips:

1. **Start Simple**: Just use `simple-cicd.yml` at first
2. **Manual Control**: You can run any workflow manually from Actions tab
3. **Save Minutes**: Workflows only run when you push changes
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check Settings → Billing to see minutes used

## ❓ Common Questions:

**Q: What happens if I exceed 2,000 minutes?**
A: Workflows pause until next month. You can upgrade for $4/month for 3,000 minutes.

**Q: Can I disable workflows?**
A: Yes! Go to Actions tab → Select workflow → ⋯ menu → Disable workflow

**Q: How do I know if my CI/CD is working?**
A: You'll see green checkmarks ✅ next to your commits on GitHub!

**Q: Is my website automatically live?**
A: Yes! Once you enable GitHub Pages, every push to main auto-deploys.

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You now have:
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Automated deployments
